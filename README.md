After switching to the CLI format, now to run the code you need to run the file start.bat and enter the path to the executable file with the permission .du

## approve

The "approve" command is used to create variables.

Sample:

    approve [name] = [type] [value];

    The name parameter specifies the name of the variable, the data type, the value, the value of the variable.

### Data type
There are eight types of data in total:

- Int
- String
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- Av
- ViewCondition
- !

Let's analyze each of them:

### Int

Int - used to create variables with numbers and manipulate them.

Sample:

    approve [name] = Int [value];

### String

String - used to create variables with text.

Sample:

    approve [name] = String [value];

### Boolean

Boolean - used to create variables with a boolean expression.

Sample:

    approve [name] = Boolean [true||false];

### Array

Array - used to create arrays—é

Sample:

    approve [name] = Boolean [1,2,3];

### Object

Object - used to create json objects.

Sample:

    approve [name] = Object {
        "[name]": 1
    };

### Av

Av - used to create variables with text, mathematical operations and the ability to insert variables.

Sample:

    approve a = Int 2;
    approve b = Int 2;
    approve [name] = Av @a+@b;

Will: 4

Variables are accessed through the symbol "@" which is a global object of variables, all text except for accessing variables must be in single or double quotes, to connect something with something, the + symbol is used.

Sample:

    approve a = Int 2;
    approve b = Int 2;
    approve [name] = Av "a+b: "+@a+@b;

Will: a+b: 4

### ViewCondition

ViewCondition - a boolean expression is placed in a variable with this type, a boolean expression in this type is not specified, it is assigned when the specified condition is met.

Sample:

    approve a = Int 2;
    approve [name] = ViewCondition @a==2;

Will: true

### !

! - reference to a comment, each comment has its own index starting from zero.

Sample:

    // :)
    approve [name] = ! 0;

Will: :)
