# DuScript

<img src="duScript.ico" width="500px">

This language was created as an experiment, it is made of shit and sticks, and it is also interpreted in JavaScript.

It works similar to YoptaScript , although they only have a similar connection method and the fact that they are interpreted in JavaScript.
